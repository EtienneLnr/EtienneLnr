## Hi there,

I’m an AI Research Scientist specializing in Deep Learning for time series and temporal data.
My work focuses on designing neural architectures capable of learning from complex temporal dynamics — from forecasting to representation learning.  
Recently, my research has been centered on developing foundation models for time series, aiming to build general-purpose models that can transfer across domains and tasks in a zero-shot manner.

### Research Interests
- Deep learning for time series and spatio-temporal modeling  
- Foundation models, large-scale pretraining and inference adaptation for time series  
- Time series representation learning and self-supervised learning  
- Imputation, forecasting, and other supervised tasks  
- Scientific and industrial applications of AI
