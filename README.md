## Hi there, I'm Etienne

I’m an **AI Research Scientist** passionate about Deep Learning for time series and temporal data.  
My work focuses on designing neural architectures capable of learning from complex temporal dynamics — from forecasting to representation learning.

### Research Interests
- Deep learning for time series and spatio-temporal modeling  
- Time series representation learning and self-supervised learning  
- Imputation, forecasting, and other supervised tasks  
- Scientific and industrial applications of AI  

### Featured Projects and Publications
